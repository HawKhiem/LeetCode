## 93. Restore IP Addresses

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be obtained by inserting dots
into `s`. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in `s`. You may return the valid IP addresses in **any
order**.

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
s = "25525511135"  
**Output:**  
["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
s = "0000"  
**Output:**  
["0.0.0.0"]

---

### Example 3:

**Input:**  
s = "101023"  
**Output:**  
["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]

---

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 20`
- `s` consists of digits only.
